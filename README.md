# Recognize Tokens Using C Program

This repository contains a simple C program designed to recognize tokens in a given input. Tokens are the basic building blocks of a programming language, including keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, and symbols.

## Features

- **Keyword Recognition**: Identifies common programming keywords.
- **Identifier Recognition**: Recognizes valid variable names.
- **Literal Recognition**: Detects integer and floating-point literals.
- **Operator Recognition**: Identifies basic arithmetic and logical operators.
- **Symbol Recognition**: Detects common symbols like parentheses, braces, and semicolons.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **C Compiler**: Ensure you have a C compiler (like GCC) installed on your system.

### Running the Program

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jubayer98/Recognize-Tokens-Using-C-Program.git
   cd Recognize-Tokens-Using-C-Program
   ```

2. **Compile the Program**:
   ```bash
   gcc g20.c -o token_recognizer
   ```

3. **Run the Program**:
   ```bash
   ./token_recognizer
   ```
